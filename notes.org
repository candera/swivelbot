* Torque calculations

- Torque determines rate of change of angular momentum
- Angular momentum is angular velocity times moment of inertia
- Moment of inertia of a thin rectangular plate of width w, height h
  and mass m is (-> m (* (+ (square h) (square w))) (/ 12))
- MacBook Pro is 6.8 pounds, 15.4 x 10.4 inches
  - That's 0.264x0.391 m, 3.08kg
  - So moment of intertia is 0.0571280966667 kg-m^2
- FOV of the iSight is something like 120 degrees
- It would be awesome if the platform could rotate through 180 degrees
  in one second.
